abstract: The IKEA Furniture Assembly Environment is one of the first benchmarks for
  testing and accelerating the automation of complex manipulation tasks. The environment
  is designed to advance reinforcement learning from simple toy tasks to complex tasks
  requiring both long-term planning and sophisticated low-level control. Our environment
  supports over 80 different furniture models, Sawyer and Baxter robot simulation,
  and domain randomization. The IKEA Furniture Assembly Environment is a testbed for
  methods aiming to solve complex manipulation tasks. The environment is publicly
  available at https://clvrai.com/furniture
