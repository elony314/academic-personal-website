I am a computer science and applied math major student in USC. My overall research interest is to develop practical statistical learning theories that can be used to build real-world machine learning systems. I believe my ultimate mission is to facilitate the democratization of artificial intelligence by developing theoretically sound machine learning systems that can learn everywhere in a distributed manner and can be used by everyone.
